Version 0.49.0
* New model with deltaPBn1

Version 0.47.2
* Created functions for simulated data analysis getSimulatedNoiseData 
* new function profileLikelihoodFrap (before only profileLikelihoodFrapPair was implemented)
* new function decouplePairs and decoupleTable, transforms one-pos-one-pair data to one-pos-one-cell data.
* implemented SIGMA.METHOD "FROM.DATA", to be able to retain the sigma estimation in the decoupled datasets
